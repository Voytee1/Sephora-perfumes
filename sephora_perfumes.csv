A radiant- floral-fruity eau de toilette- this utterly joyful fragrance bursts with tasty colors- juicy undertones- and an abundance of flowers.

These notes create a smooth- enveloping trail that adds a light- sensual nuance to a joyful and colorful scent.

It was the first of its kind â€” ground-breaking for Beauxâ€™s innovative use of aldehydes- or synthetic components which add layers of complexity- making NÂ°5 shockingly modern in an era of single-note scents. As the most potent symbol of the luxurious simplicity for which Chanel is renowned- NÂ°5 has since become more than a fragrance. It is an olfactory heritage: an idea of femininity- a masterpiece of chic- passed on from generation to generation. The now and forever fragrance.Designed in 1921 by Gabrielle Chanel herself- the simple lines and incredibly plain white label of The Classic Bottle were as surprising as the fragrance. The chiseled stopper- cut like a diamond- was inspired by the geometry of the Place VendÃ´me that Gabrielle could gaze at from the balcony of her room at the Ritz in Paris. Over the years- only subtle changes have been made to the original design in order to preserve its stunningly contemporary aesthetic.Since the creation of NÂ°5- Chanel has practiced the art of baudruchage to seal bottles of parfum. Performed entirely by hand- the technique consists of placing a fine membrane over the neck of the bottle and holding it in place with two rows of pearl-cotton thread. It is then closed with a wax seal. From this moment- a pact of exclusiveness is sealed: the bottle can only be opened by the woman for whom it is destined.  COMPOSITION A bouquet of abstract flowers is how Gabrielle Chanel described NÂ°5- a floral-aldehydic fragrance whose formula requires no less than eighty ingredients. At first- the scent unfolds with a stunning surge of Ylang-Ylang and Neroli (bitter orange tree blossom). Then- a perfect harmony of voluptuous May Rose and sensuous Jasmine from Grasse emerges- followed by a vibrant woody base of Sandalwood- Bourbon Vetiver and Vanilla. An ever-changing fragrance with no single dominant note- NÂ°5 boasts the incredible power of being able to be interpreted differently based on the wearer- thus revealing each womanâ€™s uniqueness. HOW TO APPLY Parfum is the most precious- concentrated and long-lasting form of fragrance- with its own specific application. Gabrielle Chanel's advice was to apply Parfum â€œwherever you want to be kissed.â€ Neck- wrist- dÃ©colletÃ©â€¦ Apply a drop of Parfum on each pulse point- letting it develop on your skin and feeling the fragrance echo the beat of your heart.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body.

Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients- including sulfates (SLS and SLES)- parabens- phthalates- and more. For the full list- check out the Ingredients tab.",Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent.Â -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly.Â -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent.Â -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Alcohol Denat.- Fragrance- Water- Glycerin- Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice- Phenoxyethanol- Coumarin- Citral- Benzyl Benzoate- Linalool- Limonene- Geraniol- Benzyl Salicylate- Citronellol.,0,1,0,0

For the full list- check out the Ingredients tab.",Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent.Â -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly.Â -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent.Â -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent.

Key Notes:
 Juicy Pomelo- Neroli- Tangerine

About:
 Commodity Nectar is inspired by crisp- sparkling citrus fruits and freshly picked neroli blossoms. This unisex fragrance is luminous and vibrant. Juicy fruits of pomelo and tangerine are blended with neroli oil and honeysuckle for a bright- zesty effect. 

Commodity Nectar EDP is part of Commodityâ€™s White Collection- which includes scents that are light- airy- and easy.
What else you need to know:
Organic orange blossoms of the bitter orange tree are hand-picked then steam distilled to produce our pure neroli oil. Due to its rare olfactory richness- the bitter orange tree has been known for centuries as the ""Perfume Tree"". Delicate and sweet with zesty citric freshness- neroli is a genuine aromatic treasure. 

""For Commodity Nectar- I was inspired by the luminous beauty of neroli that captures an elegant radiance and refreshing zest of the bitter orange tree. Highly scented- the freshly-picked petals are so sweet and sparkling- I wanted to evoke a paradise of sunlit citrus- further touched by the breezy white floral notes of orange blossom to create a tantalizing- distinctive aroma of vibrancy.""â€”Mathieu Nardin- Commodity Perfumer

Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients- including sulfates (SLS and SLES)- parabens- phthalates- and more. For the full list- check out the Ingredients tab.",Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent.Â -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly.Â -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent.Â -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent.

","Suggested Usage:
-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. 
-After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. 
-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. 
-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.

 Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:
The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to 9%- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14%. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.

The base of addictive patchouli and the unique ambery dry-down have been greatly enhanced for a darker and more provocative trail.Gucci Guilty Intense bottle replicates the sleek fusion of metal and glass of Gucci Guilty. The original's muted metallic casing has been transformed into a richer- more opulent gold-  creating a sleek fusion with the smoky grey glass. The signature interlocking ""G""s form a window to the delicate amber juice- making the flacon as covetable an accessory as the latest Gucci bag.Notes:Mandarin- Pink Pepper- Peach- Lilac- Geranium- Ambery Notes- Patchouli.

-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. 
-After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. 
-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. 
-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.

 Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:
The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.

About:
 A novel written by Maurice Roucel in 1995- 24 Faubourg is an invitation to travel- with the sun as a destination. White flowers sparkle in the top notes- the radiance of a floral heart is enveloped in iris- wood- and mystery- while vanilla and ambergris set the tone for the sillage.

The Eau de parfum is a patch of light. A swathe of white flowers opening out in the sunlight- the mystery and sensuality of vanilla and sandalwood.
The Eau de toilette is vibrant like a sunny morning.

The memory of this very moment- sensual- and electric- leaving a dream-filled trail of wild wonder just like the fragrance.About the Bottle: The story of Vanilla Vibes continues with the bottle- gradient shades of pink and blue recall memories of nightfall when then sun dips into the deep blue horizon. Warm colors contrast with the metallic feel of the cap and the holographic logo.About the Fragrance: â€œWanting to work with vanilla for some time and challenged by not being a huge fan of sweet notes- I needed to find a twist. I chose sea salt- which made the vanilla far from overwhelmingâ€”more elegant.â€â€”Romano Ricci- Perfumer,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent.Â -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly.Â -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent.Â -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent.

Scent Type: Warm Florals
Key Notes: Orange Blossom- Hyacinth- Jonquil- Cattleya Leopoldii Orchid- Suede Accord- Vanilla Tincture
Fragrance Description: Brilliant. Lavish. Refined. Velvet Orchid is a fragrance that lives in the black orchid world of glamorous mystique- sharing its aura yet standing apart with its own compelling identity. It pushes the D.N.A. of the original Black Orchid into new territory- evolving hidden facets of the original's olfactive structure with extravagant ingredients to reveal even more brilliance- femininity- and attractive force. 
About the Fragrance: In Velvet Orchid- the daring and dramatic floral signature of black orchid is the inspiration for a warm and enveloping fragrance that is lavished with shimmering freshness- dramatic petals- honey- and rum. The woods and spices of the original scent recede and a contrasting veil of petally floralcy casts a shadow of ultra-femininity throughout. A new character emerges: one that pulls rather than pushes; and that is more harmonious than mysteriousâ€”elegantly refined and polished. Velvet Orchid has an addicting beauty that seduces with a fluid and textured touch. It is the rippling black silk next to black orchid's sleek marble. Velvet Orchid masterfully embellishes and evolves the Black Orchid legacy.  
""To this day- velvet is my favorite fabric. The woman who wears this is not a wildflower. Sheâ€™s an urban flower- sheâ€™s a hothouse flower- sheâ€™s an orchid.""â€”Tom Ford

Key Notes: French Lavender- Italian Bergamot- Tonka Bean

Fragrance Description: An element pushed to the extreme- two distinct lavenders merge from the start. Lavender from the Hautes-Alpes region of Provence grows in the high mountains and pulses with adrenaline-pumping freshness. Lavender in the valley dries for three days- allowing the lavender oil to develop its unique character with amber-like facets. Vibrant Italian Bergamot drenches the herbaceous open with citrus.

At the heart- daucus carotaâ€”transformed through an exclusive enzyme processâ€”eradicates earthiness and amplifies the fresher expression and orris qualities. A third pure lavender propels Lavender ExtrÃªme beyond all expectations. Lavender Absolute France punches up a balsamic core with green undertones.

The oriental dimension at the finish builds on the warm glow of wild-grown Tonka Bean. Sourced in Laos- the creamy wood effect of Benzoin hooks with a final dose of ExtrÃªmeâ€™s charismatic audacity- potent and excessively luxurious.


About the Fragrance: ""Lavender ExtrÃªme is fresh- divergent- and stimulating. Lavender is reworked and refracted to become something irreverently newâ€”a stunning- electric creation to be worn at maximum volume.â€â€”TOM FORD

","Suggested Usage:
-On clean skin- spray fragrance once or twice on desired areas. Do not rub the fragrance on skin- as this will alter how the fragrance develops.

About:
 BONBON evokes a timeless sensation- inviting a pure and absolute pursuit of pleasure. She who wears BONBON dresses herself in perfume while creating her own story. She is empowered- beautiful- and complete.

Bonbon is a delicious fragrance created with the intent to fuel desire through a scent so irresistible that one would deem it edible. It is composed of sparkling- effervescent mandarin and orange slices crystalized into crackling pieces of caramel wrapping succulent fruits. The sweetness of paradise peach accord flirts tenderly with supple caramel notes- clinging to the roundness of peachâ€™s fleecy surface. Sun-filled jasmine is sustained by orange blossom whose sweet flavor clings to the soft smell of caramel. The fragrance flows languidly across the skin- as caramel would generously drip over an indulgent dessert. Finally- gÃ¯aic and cedar woods blend into the base note to achieve a surprising balance between smooth- creamy- milky sandalwood notes and the upright- stronger and darker notes of woody amber. The rich brown facets of the caramel accord are tenderly overcooked.

Beauty Tip:
Layer with BONBON Shower Gel- Body Lotion- Hair Mist- Body Cream- or Body Power to enhance and prolong the experience.

What else you need to know:
Woven throughout the Viktor & Rolf collections- the bow forms an iconic design symbol in the houseâ€™s rich heritage and embodies the essence of the couture spirit. Sculpted to perfection- the one-of-a-kind BONBON bow bottle proves that the impossible is possible. Its design was handcrafted with precision and craftsmanship- much like the detail involved in the creation of a couture garment.
